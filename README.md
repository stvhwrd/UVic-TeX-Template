An easily customisable and structured [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) template for [UVic](https://uvic.ca) reports, papers, and assignments.

## Usage

Deploying to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/signup?ref=cdde14988a59) <sup>(referral link)</sup>:
1. Create a project on Overleaf.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Clone your forked repository locally.
4. Authenticate and [integrate your cloned repository with Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/help/233-how-do-i-connect-an-overleaf-project-with-a-repo-on-github-gitlab-or-bitbucket).  I usually just set it up so that I have two upstreams - `github` and `overleaf` (I rename `origin` to `github`) - this way you can `git push overleaf` and/or `git push github` explicitly.
5. Your PDFs will be generated on Overleaf at your project URL, and your source will be version controlled in GitHub.
